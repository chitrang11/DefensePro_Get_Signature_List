# Overview 
The script's purpose is to provide a list of signatures with a description of the signature that DefensePro's profile is using (SignatureList.csv and SignatureList.json).
The script interacts with Radware APSolute Vision and DefensePro (via APSolute Vision) and collects all the necessary data through REST API calls.


## IMPORTANT
‚óè Read the entire file before attempting to configure or execute it.


# Script Output
The script output generates one report in both CSV and JSON format in the same script directory (SignatureList.csv and SignatureList.json).
Note: CVS default 
To read the signature description columns on the CSV file, please select all the data and perform AutoFit columns and rows(https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-the-column-width-and-row-height-72f5e3cc-994d-43e8-ae58-9774a0905f46).
